â–¶ **Best Practice Delivery Methodologies.** Designed and engineered using industry best practice delivery methodologies supporting the adoption of Agile delivery using DevOps principles and practices. 

â–¶ **Automation.** Provides automation to enable our customers to quickly onboard new features and business services and also to quickly modify existing services.

ðŸ“£ Let's understand why do we invent this solution. As you may aware of that  Peered Virtual Network is not supported to use from Azure Bastion Host. â€“ so larger enterprises are ruled out here no one in their right mind will deploy 500 bastion hosts (one per VNet) in a large enterprise. We have aimed this solution to create backend Virtual Network which will be called as jumpoint virtual network and deploying Jumpoint VMs to access accross peered virtual network.

## ðŸš€ Get Up and Running Jumpoint in 15 Minutes

  You can get a new Gatsby site up and running on your local dev environment in 5 minutes with these four steps:

1. **Install the Azure Powershell which is called as 'AZ'**

   ```shell
   npm install -g gatsby-cli

   ```

2. **Create a Gatsby site from a Gatsby starter.**

   Get your Gatsby blog set up in a single command:

   ```shell
   # create a new Gatsby site using the default starter
   gatsby new my-blazing-fast-site
   ```

3. **Start the site in `develop` mode.**

   Next, move into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up:

   ```shell
   cd my-blazing-fast-site/
   gatsby develop
   ```

4. **Open the source code and start editing!**

   Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`. Open the `my-blazing-fast-site` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes, and the browser will update in real time!

At this point, youâ€™ve got a fully functional Gatsby website. For additional information on how you can customize your Gatsby site, see our [plugins](https://gatsbyjs.org/plugins/) and [the official tutorial](https://gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).
