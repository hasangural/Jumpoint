â–¶ **Best Practice Delivery Methodologies.** Designed and engineered using industry best practice delivery methodologies supporting the adoption of Agile delivery using DevOps principles and practices. 

â–¶ **Automation.** Provides automation to enable our customers to quickly onboard new features and business services and also to quickly modify existing services.

**ðŸ“£Note that** Let's understand why do we invent this solution. As you may aware of that  Peered Virtual Network is not supported to use from Azure Bastion Host. â€“ so larger enterprises are ruled out here no one in their right mind will deploy 500 bastion hosts (one per VNet) in a large enterprise. We have aimed this solution to create backend Virtual Network which will be called as jumpoint virtual network and deploying Jumpoint VMs to access accross peered virtual network.
